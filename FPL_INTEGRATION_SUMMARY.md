# FPL API Integration - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the FPL API integration, which uses JSON data files to simulate the FPL API and populate the Supabase database with complete league data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. FPL Data Service (`lib/fpl-data-service.ts`)
- Reads JSON files from the `fpldata/` folder
- Simulates FPL API endpoints:
  - League standings: `/api/leagues-classic/{league_id}/standings/`
  - Manager history: `/api/entry/{entry_id}/history/`
  - Manager details: `/api/entry/{entry_id}/`
  - Manager transfers: `/api/entry/{entry_id}/transfers/`
- Includes browser-compatible methods for future API integration

### 2. Data Mappers (`lib/fpl-mappers.ts`)
- Transforms FPL API data structures to database schema
- Maps league standings to teams table
- Maps manager history to team_summaries table
- Maps chips data to chips table
- Includes validation functions for data integrity

### 3. Sync Service (`lib/fpl-sync.ts`)
- Orchestrates the complete data synchronization process
- Handles all 32 teams from league standings
- Processes detailed data for Erik's team (ID: 89341)
- Creates default summaries for teams without detailed data
- Includes error handling and status reporting

### 4. Updated Admin Panel (`components/admin-panel.tsx`)
- Replaced "Load Sample Data" with "Sync from JSON Data"
- Uses the new FPL sync service
- Updated league ID from 33122 to 66185
- Provides detailed sync status and error reporting

### 5. Updated Database Functions (`lib/database.ts`)
- Updated default league ID to 66185
- Maintains compatibility with existing database operations

## Current Data Structure

### Teams Table
- All 32 teams from the league standings
- Complete with rankings, points, and manager information

### Team Summaries Table
- Full 38-gameweek history for Erik's team
- Default summaries for other teams (GW38 data)
- Includes points, transfers, overall rank, value, bank, and chips used

### Chips Table
- Complete chip usage history for Erik's team
- 6 chips: wildcard (GW4), 3xc (GW25), wildcard (GW30), manager (GW31), freehit (GW34), bboost (GW38)

### League Metadata Table
- League ID: 66185 (updated from 33122)
- League name: "La Jungla LV - Premier Legue"
- 32 total entries
- Current event: 38

## How to Use

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Log into the admin panel
2. **Sync Data**: Click "Sync from JSON Data" button
3. **Verify**: Check the database status counters to confirm data was loaded
4. **View Data**: Navigate to the main app to see league standings and team details

## Phase 2: Real API Integration

When ready to switch to the real FPL API (after the season starts), you'll need to:

### 1. Create API Endpoints
Create Next.js API routes in `app/api/fpl/` folder:
- `app/api/fpl/leagues/[leagueId]/standings/route.ts`
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/history/route.ts`
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/route.ts`
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/transfers/route.ts`

### 2. Update FPL Data Service
Replace the JSON file reading with actual HTTP calls to:
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/leagues-classic/{league_id}/standings/`
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/{entry_id}/history/`
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/{entry_id}/`
- `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/{entry_id}/transfers/`

### 3. Add Rate Limiting and Error Handling
- Implement proper rate limiting (FPL API has limits)
- Add retry logic for failed requests
- Handle cases where manager data might not be available

### 4. Automated Sync
- Add scheduled sync functionality (cron jobs or similar)
- Implement smart caching to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Add conflict resolution for data updates

## Testing

The integration was tested with a Node.js script that successfully:
- ✅ Read all JSON data files
- ✅ Mapped 32 teams for database insertion
- ✅ Mapped 38 team summaries for Erik's team
- ✅ Mapped 6 chips for database insertion
- ✅ Validated data structure compatibility

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `lib/fpl-data-service.ts` - FPL data service (uses API endpoints)
- `lib/fpl-mappers.ts` - Data transformation functions
- `lib/fpl-sync.ts` - Sync orchestration service
- `app/api/fpl/leagues/[leagueId]/standings/route.ts` - API endpoint for league standings
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/history/route.ts` - API endpoint for manager history
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/route.ts` - API endpoint for manager details
- `app/api/fpl/entry/[entryId]/transfers/route.ts` - API endpoint for manager transfers

### Modified Files:
- `components/admin-panel.tsx` - Updated to use new sync service
- `lib/database.ts` - Updated league ID to 66185

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Integration**: Use the admin panel to sync data and verify everything works
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check that all 32 teams and detailed data load correctly
3. **Prepare for Phase 2**: When the new FPL season starts, implement the real API calls
4. **Add Features**: Consider adding automated sync scheduling and more detailed error reporting

The foundation is now in place for a robust FPL data integration that can seamlessly transition from JSON data to live API data.
